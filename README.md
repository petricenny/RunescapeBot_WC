Look at the following to set-up development environment

Download and run dreambot at least once before to setup the environment


Roadmap
-------------------
1) Complete firemaking programming. Will light a log after chopping tree. This is important because waiting for full inventory may cause character to stray to different area, potentially with muggers.
2) Complete mining bot. Will switch from chopping trees/firemaking to mining after some time that is yet to be determined.
3) Complete idle bot. Send character to random location to idle at as a "break" from skilling
4) Implement mouse "fatigue" aspect. After 10 minutes slow down the mouse speed. From that point generate a number between 4-10 and decrease mouse speed after that many minutes
5) Change mouse movement pattern. Either implement patterns based on personal mouse movements, selecting a pattern based on absolute distance of X and Y coordinates, or use a mathematical model.
6) Complete combat bot. Killing cows, tanning hide, then banking the tanned hides.
7) Socket programming to remotely enable the bot client.
8) Headless activation of bot to enable more clients.
